# Multiagents Simulation
This project simulates the traffic of an avenue located near my university.The purpose was to experiment with the time of the traffic lights so we could find a way to reduce the traffic of the avenue.

The simulations works with a JSON that is created with a python script that works with a multiagents model. The JSON file contains the coordenates and direction of every car for each frame. With the html you can see the animation with different options such as views and textures.

I worked on the front-end so my contributions were adding objects to the simulation, textures and the function that updates the scene.
